I've been working as a Data Scientist in Telcom for 10 months (see my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nmmichalak/)). Before starting my role in industry, I was a Data Science Fellow at [Insight Data Science](https://www.linkedin.com/company/insight-data-science/) and a Social Psychologist working with [Josh Ackerman](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/esplab/) at the University of Michigan. More broadly, I have 10 years of experience conducting research in the social sciences with a focus on motivation and social cognition. I'm skilled in statistical modeling, machine learning, and experimental design.

As a Data Science Fellow, I spent 7 (intense) weeks honing my skills in computer science fundamentals, applied statistical modeling, and machine learning. During four of those weeks, I developed a Flask web application—Next Escape ([nextescape.me](http://www.nextescape.me/))—that simplifies web searches for users looking for an ideal escape room or escape rooms similar to ones they’ve played and enjoyed before ([GitHub](https://github.com/nmmichalak/escape_room_reviews) | [Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RCBXn4WkoOG4bJ8z8Ea1XIvNH4y2gdLmdS8SL4KOmgY/edit)).

As a psychology researcher, I used advanced methods and statistics to study how both modern and evolutionarily-relevant threats affect how people perceive themselves and others. For example, I used the reverse correlation image classification task to estimate mental representations of infected persons. I’m currently conducting a Cross-Temporal Meta-Analysis to test whether stereotype threat effects have dissapated over time, depending on negatively stereotyped group (e.g., Women, Black Americans).
